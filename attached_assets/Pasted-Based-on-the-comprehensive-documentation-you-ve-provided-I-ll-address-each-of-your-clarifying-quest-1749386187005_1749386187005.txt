Based on the comprehensive documentation you've provided, I'll address each of your clarifying questions with recommendations that align with your freemium business model and conversion optimization goals:

## 1. Content Moderation Specifics

**Moderation Thresholds**: **No difference between free and premium users** for content moderation. Both tiers should have identical content quality standards to maintain platform integrity. However, premium users could receive priority in the appeal process (faster human review).

**Google Cloud Vision Fallback**: 
1. **Primary fallback**: AWS Rekognition with same confidence thresholds
2. **Secondary fallback**: Temporary queue for manual review if both APIs fail
3. **Emergency mode**: Allow uploads but flag all content for batch review within 24 hours

**Content Appeals Process**:
```
User Appeal → Automated Re-scan (different AI model) → Human Review Queue
```
- Automated re-review using AWS Rekognition if original was Google Vision
- If confidence scores differ significantly (>30 points), auto-approve
- Otherwise, queue for human review with original context

## 2. Freemium Conversion Strategy

**Upgrade Prompt Timing**: **Immediate but educational approach**
- Show upgrade prompt immediately when limit is hit
- Include educational content explaining premium value
- Offer "Learn More" option with detailed feature comparison
- Allow 2-3 dismissals before showing persistent reminder

**A/B Testing for Paywall**: **Essential for optimization**
```javascript
// Example A/B test structure
const paywallVariants = {
  A: { emphasis: 'features', trialLength: '14-day' },
  B: { emphasis: 'savings', trialLength: '14-day' },
  C: { emphasis: 'social', trialLength: '7-day' }
};
```

**Premium User Badges**: **Yes, but subtle**
- Small "Pro" badge next to usernames in recipe comments
- "Premium Recipe" indicator for recipes with advanced features (OCR imports)
- Premium user recipe highlights in search results (not overly prominent)

## 3. Media Management Details

**10-Image Limit**: **Apply to both tiers equally** 
- This maintains content quality while preventing spam
- Premium users get unlimited collections, not unlimited images per recipe
- Focus premium value on import capabilities and social features

**Video Thumbnails**: **Auto-generated with manual override option**
- Auto-generate thumbnail at 25% video duration
- Allow manual selection from 3-4 auto-generated options
- Premium users get advanced thumbnail editing tools

**Progressive Image Loading**: **Yes, essential for mobile users**
```javascript
// Loading strategy
1. Show 150x150 thumbnail immediately
2. Load 600x600 on viewport entry
3. Full resolution on user interaction
```

## 4. Technical Implementation Preferences

**Offline Functionality**: **Tiered caching strategy**
- **Free users**: Recipe metadata + primary image only
- **Premium users**: Full recipe data + all images + videos (with size limits)
- **Smart sync**: Changed content only, not full re-download

**Real-time vs Periodic Sync**: **Hybrid approach**
- **Real-time**: Subscription status, content moderation results
- **Periodic**: Media assets, recipe collections (every 30 seconds active, 5 minutes background)
- **Manual sync**: User-triggered for immediate needs

**Image Compression**: **Client-side preprocessing + server-side optimization**
```javascript
// Client-side: Quick resize for UI responsiveness
// Server-side: Professional compression for storage optimization
// Benefits: Faster upload perception + optimized storage costs
```

## 5. Development Priorities

Based on your freemium model's success factors, I recommend this **modified phased approach**:

### **Phase 1A: Freemium Foundation + Core Media (Months 1-2)**
```
Week 1-2: Authentication + Subscription tiers
Week 3-4: Basic media upload pipeline
Week 5-6: Recipe creation with image requirements
Week 7-8: Tier-based limitations + upgrade prompts
```

**Rationale**: Media is core to your value proposition. Users need to see recipe quality immediately to understand upgrade value.

### **Phase 1B: Platform Priority - Mobile First**
Start with **React Native mobile** for these reasons:
- Recipe photography is primarily mobile behavior
- App store reviews crucial for organic growth
- Push notifications essential for conversion optimization
- Mobile users show higher conversion rates in freemium apps

**Web platform**: Launch simultaneously using Expo web, but optimize mobile experience first.

### **Recommended Sprint Structure**:

**Sprint 1-2: Core Infrastructure**
- [ ] Subscription management with Stripe
- [ ] Basic authentication and user tiers
- [ ] PostgreSQL schema with media support
- [ ] Cloudflare R2 CDN setup

**Sprint 3-4: Media Pipeline** 
- [ ] Image upload with compression
- [ ] Content moderation integration
- [ ] Basic recipe creation with mandatory images
- [ ] Free tier limitations (10 saves, 1 collection)

**Sprint 5-6: Conversion Optimization**
- [ ] Upgrade prompts and paywall modals
- [ ] Trial management and tracking
- [ ] Basic analytics and A/B testing framework
- [ ] Ad integration for free tier

**Sprint 7-8: Social Features**
- [ ] Recipe browsing with visual emphasis
- [ ] Basic social interactions (saves, ratings)
- [ ] Premium user differentiation
- [ ] Advanced search (premium only)

This approach ensures you have a **compelling freemium experience** with clear upgrade incentives by Month 2, allowing for immediate user acquisition and conversion testing.

## Key Success Metrics to Track Early:

1. **Media Upload Success Rate**: >98% (affects core value proposition)
2. **Free-to-Premium Conversion**: Track daily during development
3. **Trial-to-Paid Conversion**: Optimize paywall immediately
4. **Content Moderation Accuracy**: Minimize false positives to avoid user frustration
5. **Image Loading Performance**: <2 seconds globally for user retention
